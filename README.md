## Insights

- The average body mass index (BMI) is approximately 31.99, which falls within the Obese range, indicating that most patients are overweight

- The average glucose level is 120.89, which is higher than the normal range (70â€“99), increasing the likelihood of developing diabetes

- The Obese category represents the largest proportion of patients (approximately 61%), followed by the Normal category (23%), indicating that obesity is a major factor in the sample

- The distribution of blood pressure shows that the 50- to 80-year-old age groups have the highest average blood pressure, increasing cardiovascular risk with age

- The percentage of patients in the "High Risk" category for diabetes is the largest (39%), indicating the need for early intervention

- Analysis of the average glucose by age shows a significant increase in glucose levels at age 60, requiring special monitoring of the older age group

- The table of Blood Pressure by Age & BMI shows that obese patients in the older age group have the highest recorded blood pressure

## Recommendations

- Weight loss programs: Launch nutritional and exercise programs specifically for the most obese groups to reduce BMI and improve health indicators

- Regular blood sugar monitoring: Especially for patients over the age of 50 and those with elevated blood glucose levels

- Health education: Hold awareness workshops on the relationship between obesity, diabetes, and heart disease

- Early screening programs: Target the 40-60 age group for early screening of blood sugar and blood pressure

- Personalized treatment plan: For patients in the high-risk group, combining lifestyle changes with close medical follow-up

- Filter impact analysis: Use filters to identify changes in indicators for each age group or BMI category to determine intervention priorities
